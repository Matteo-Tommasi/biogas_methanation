\section{Introduction}

So, why is everyone obsessed with CO2 to methanol?

Una corposa schiera di autori si Ã¨ cimentata in questo negli anni passati,


Per qualche strana ragione

Why is everyone so obsessed with LatEx in Academia?

Your introduction goes here! Simply start writing your document and use the Recompile button to view the updated PDF preview. Examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Once you're familiar with the editor, you can find various project settings in the Overleaf menu, accessed via the button in the very top left of the editor. To view tutorials, user guides, and further documentation, please visit our \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn}{help library}, or head to our plans page to \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{choose your plan}.

\section{Some examples to get started}

\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Simply use the section and subsection commands, as in this example document! With Overleaf, all the formatting and numbering is handled automatically according to the template you have chosen. If you are using the Visual Editor, you can also create new section and subsections via the buttons in the editor toolbar.

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link in the file-tree menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

Note that your figure will automatically be placed in the most appropriate place for it, given the surrounding text and taking into account other figures or tables that may be close by. You can find out more about adding images to your documents in this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Including_images_on_Overleaf}{including images on Overleaf}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{frog.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded via the file-tree menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular environments for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. For more information, please see this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/tables}{tables}. 

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to add Comments and Track Changes}

You can insert comments into your project by selecting text and choosing "Add comment" in the upper right of the editor window. To view comments already present, go to the Review menu in the toolbar. To respond to a comment, use the Reply button located in the bottom right corner of the comment box. To exit the Review pane, click its name on the toolbar once you are done. Track changes are included in all our \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{premium plans} and can be toggled via the top option in the Review pane. This feature helps you monitor all document edits, along with the identity of the person who made them.. 

\subsection{How to add Lists}

Equation:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{c}
e^{i x}=1+i x-\frac{x^{2}}{2!}-i \frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\ldots= \\
=\left(1-\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\ldots\right)+i\left(x-\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\ldots\right)=\cos x+i \sin x
\end{array}
\end{equation}



You can make lists with test numbering \dots

\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{l}
x^{2}-6 x+5=0\left\{\begin{array}{l}
a=1 \\
b=-6 \\
c=5
\end{array}\right. \\
x_{1 / 2}=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{6^{2}-4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5}}{2 \cdot 1} \\
x_{1 / 2}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36-20}}{2}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2}=\frac{6 \pm 4}{2} \\
x_{1 / 2}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x_{1}=\frac{6+4}{2}=\frac{10}{2}=5 \\
x_{2}=\frac{6-4}{2}=\frac{2}{2}=1
\end{array}\right.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,

\item The track change seem ok
\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}


\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


\subsection{How to change the margins and paper size}

Usually the template you're using will have the page margins and paper size set correctly for that use-case. For example, if you're using a journal article template provided by the journal publisher, that template will be formatted according to their requirements. In these cases, it's best not to alter the margins directly.

If however you're using a more general template, such as this one, and would like to alter the margins, a common way to do so is via the geometry package. You can find the geometry package loaded in the preamble at the top of this example file, and if you'd like to learn more about how to adjust the settings, please visit this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/page_size_and_margins}{page size and margins}.

\subsection{How to change the document language and spell check settings}

Overleaf supports many different languages, including multiple different languages within one document. 

To configure the document language, simply edit the option provided to the babel package in the preamble at the top of this example project. To learn more about the different options, please visit this help article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/International_language_support}{international language support}.

To change the spell check language, simply open the Overleaf menu at the top left of the editor window, scroll down to the spell check setting, and adjust accordingly.

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can simply upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with a tool such as JabRef. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|. You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

If you have an \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{upgraded account}, you can also import your Mendeley or Zotero library directly as a \verb|.bib| file, via the upload menu in the file-tree.
